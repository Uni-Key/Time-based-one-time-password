  Hey TwinFlames,=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  We're reaching out to let you know that we have made some changes to ho=
w 2FA with SMS is configured on GitHub.com.=0D
  As part of the two-factor authentication initiative (2FA) that <a href=3D=
"https://github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-develop=
er-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/">we announced last year</a> we'v=
e added the ability to have both SMS and an authenticator app (TOTP) 2FA =
methods registered at the same time. =0D
  While you are already enrolled in 2FA, we have made some changes that u=
pdate your use of the fallback SMS number. =0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  <b>No action is required on your part</b>, but please see below for mor=
e information about this change. =0D
  You can also read about this change in <a href=3D"https://github.blog/c=
hangelog/2023-03-02-sms-and-totp-can-now-both-be-registered-2fa-methods/"=
>today&#39;s blog post</a>.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  Making the software supply chain more secure is a team effort, and we c=
an't do it without you.=0D
  Your enrollment in 2FA is an impactful step in keeping the world's soft=
ware secure.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<h3>Changes to SMS two-factor authentication (2FA)</h3>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  We now support both SMS and TOTP 2FA methods at the same time instead o=
f supporting only a "fallback" SMS feature, which allows you to receive a=
 text message to recover your account. =0D
  For most accounts, we have migrated their fallback SMS number to a stan=
dard SMS registration, alongside their TOTP method.=0D
  However, your account is part of a small set that has both a primary SM=
S and fallback SMS registered.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  As a result, no change has been made to your account. You still have ac=
cess to this fallback SMS registration. You can use it during account rec=
overy, and update it at <a href=3D"https://github.com/settings/security">=
https://github.com/settings/security</a> if you wish.=0D
  However, if you remove it from your account, you will not be able to ad=
d it back.=0D
  You can learn more about 2FA configuration at <a href=3D"https://docs.g=
ithub.com/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentica=
tion-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication">https://docs.github.com/a=
uthentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/co=
nfiguring-two-factor-authentication</a>.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<h4>Is any action required for my SMS registrations?</h4>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  No. Your primary SMS number is still registered, and can be used for 2F=
A during sign in.=0D
  Your fallback SMS number is still valid as well, for account recovery p=
urposes. However,=0D
  if you choose to delete the fallback SMS number, you will lose the abil=
ity to add it back in.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  Please review your SMS numbers at <a href=3D"https://github.com/setting=
s/security">https://github.com/settings/security</a> to ensure that both =
of them are still valid=0D
  contact methods for you =E2=80=93 out-of-date SMS numbers are a securit=
y risk for your account if someone else now uses that number.=0D
</p>=0D
=0D
<p>=0D
  In addition, we recommend that you add additional authentication method=
s to your account beyond SMS, for security and reliability.=0D
  Most phones and computers support security keys, which you can quickly =
register by going to <a href=3D"https://github.com/settings/security">htt=
ps://github.com/settings/security</a>.=0D
